# Changelog

All notable changes to AgencityLab are documented here.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-08-10

### Foundations

- Synchronized package metadata and runtime `__version__` at `0.1.12`.
- Corrected the declared Python requirement to `>=3.10` after CI exposed the existing use of `dataclass(slots=True)`, which is not supported by Python 3.9.
- Corrected pytest discovery to use the repository-level `tests/` suite.
- Established a correctness-focused Ruff baseline across the package and tests and modernized the Ruff configuration.
- Added build tooling to the development dependencies.
- Added an `export` optional dependency group for Excel and PDF export backends.
- Replaced the self-referential `all` extra with explicit optional dependencies.
- Added GitHub Actions CI for Python 3.10 and 3.11 with import, Ruff, pytest, and package-build checks.
- Added foundation tests for package metadata and the public compute API.
- Repaired the characteristic-time API wiring so the compute pipeline can pass structural metadata context without failing at runtime.
- Updated smoke, integration, regression, and analysis tests to exercise the public API with explicit scientific input keywords.
- Reworked the README, contribution guide, overview, and theory mapping to state the alpha/research status clearly and remove unresolved merge-conflict markers.
- Documented known differences between the current theory sources and legacy numerical choices in memory, organisation, and CRM handling.

### Deferred maintenance debt

- Broader Ruff style cleanup remains outside the v0.1 scientific-foundation change so formatting and naming churn do not obscure theory reconciliation.

### Deferred to the 0.2 scientific reconciliation phase

- Reconcile the current code definitions of `M` and `O` with the current theory source definitions.
- Decide explicitly whether any `tanh` compression remains as an experimental/legacy transform or is removed from the canonical path.
- Reconcile the canonical `tau` CRM window with advanced/experimental window parameterisations and the existing short-observation compression rule.
- Resolve theory-source differences involving reduced versus raw variables and the logarithmic regularisation convention before changing scientific code.

## 0.1.0

- Initial project skeleton.
